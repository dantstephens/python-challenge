## About this project

This project consists of two different excercises _PyBank_ and _PyPoll_. Each excercise seeks to extract data from a CSV file, complete an analysis, and then output the results to the terminal and a TXT file. 

The scripts use **OS** and **CSV** modules to import the resrouce files, but do not use any additional modules to complete the analysis. 

### PyBank

The script for PyBank analyzes profits and losses from an organization of a period of time. The result of the analysis looks at how long the period is as well as the total profit or loss over the period. Additionally, it looks at the change from month to month to determine the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profits as well as the average monthly change over the period. 

### PyPoll

The script for PyPoll analyzes voter data for a set of candidadtes. The result of the analysis looks at the total number of votes across all candidates as well as the number of votes each candidate receives and the percentage of votes that each candidate took. Finally, the winner is declared based on the candidate with the highest number of votes. 

## Accessing resources for this project

The completed scripts for each project can be accessed in the [PyBank](PyBank) and [PyPoll](PyPoll) folders respectively. Please download the entire folder to retain the path to resource files. 

## Running the script

After downloading the folder with the script and resource files, run the main.py script from within the folder to ensure that the path to the resource files is retained. 

Once the script has completed, the completed analysis of the resource CSV file is output to the terminal, as well as to a TXT file in the _analysis_ folder.
